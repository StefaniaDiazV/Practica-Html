 <h1>What Love Has Taught Us</h1>
<span>Eric Chou</span>  <span>What love has taught us</span>  <span>2016</span>

<h2>Letra</h2>
<p>What love has taught us<br>
Standing at a random bridge, looking at a random photo, remembering the word about love is coming<br>
This world is fascinating as you end up not having something you want so badly</p>
     
<p>The last argument makes none cheering and solitude roars<br>
 Nothing can replace our beautiful memory, we were crying and <br>laughing before leaving</p>

<p> I didn't mean to hurt your feelings as I am still confused<br>
Bravery has taught me & those who love me a thing</p>

<p>So fortunate to have found you<br>
So relentless for me loving you<br>
I face a lot of tasks from destiny<br>
But I know not to give up</p>
     
<p>So fortunate of embracing you<br>
    So resent of losing you<br>
    Such a shame to miss potential love<br>
    I knew that it remains in my heart, all I think of is you</p>

<p>The last argument makes none cheering and solitude roars<br>
    Nothing can replace our beautiful memory, we were crying and laughing before leaving</p>

<p>I didn't mean to hurt your feelings as I am still confused<br>
    Bravery has taught me & those who love me a thing</p>

<p>So fortunate to have found you<br>
    So relentless for me loving you<br>
    I face a lot of tasks from destiny<br>
    But I know not to give up</p>

 <p>Who can tell that happiness is always beautiful<br>
    No more regrets about how would it end<br>
    Time won't rewind<br>
    Tear drops while thinking about you</p>

<p>So fortunate to have found you<br>
    So relentless for me loving you<br>
    I face a lot of tasks from destiny<br>
    But I know not to give up</p>

<p>So fortunate of embracing you<br>
    So resent of losing you<br>
    Such a shame to miss potential love<br>
    I knew that it remains in my heart, all I think of is you</p>
